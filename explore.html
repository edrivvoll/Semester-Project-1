        <h2>For Kids</h2>
        <p>
          Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on
          down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why
          not travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our
          exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make
          sure you come ready to learn and explore.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a
          Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and
          experiment with our team of experts.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can
          join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery. Each
          holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about the
          holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.

        <p>
          As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create
          places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to give your
          students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning
          laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite and
          inspire them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please get in touch with us here to find out more about our facilities
          and to arrange a time to bring your students through for a visit.
